## Self Introduction
Hi, my name is **Jack** and I am from Shanghai, China. I was born in **Xinjiang** but I moved to Shanghai in 9th grade. My major is still undecided yet but I am planning on studying History, Psychology or Music. In my free time, I love to read history books, listen to orchestra music and watch war movies. I am also engaged in **mountain climbing**, basketball and boxing activties. I felt so lucky to be as a part of the W&M community and I look forward to our upcoming classes !

Here's a picture of me.
